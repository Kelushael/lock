```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure API credentials**:
   - Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export KRAKEN_API_KEY="your_kraken_api_key"

   ```
   - Or edit `config.py` directly (not recommended for production)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize the trading parameters:

```python
# Trading Parameters
MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD = Decimal('0.3')  # 0.3% minimum profit
MIN_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 0.7             # Minimum confidence score
MAX_POSITION_SIZE = Decimal('500')     # Max USD per trade
MIN_LIQUIDITY = Decimal('500')         # Minimum liquidity required

# Risk Management
MAX_DAILY_TRADES = 100                 # Maximum trades per day
MAX_DAILY_LOSS = Decimal('500')        # Maximum daily loss limit
STOP_LOSS_PCT = Decimal('2.0')         # Stop loss percentage

# System Parameters
SCAN_INTERVAL = 1.0                    # Seconds between scans
MAX_IDLE_MINUTES = 10                  # Max minutes without trades
```

### Trading Pairs

The system monitors these pairs by default:
- XBTUSD (Bitcoin)
- ETHUSD (Ethereum)
- ADAUSD (Cardano)
- DOTUSD (Polkadot)
- SOLUSD (Solana)
- And more...

You can customize the trading pairs in `config.py`.

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Trading System

1. **Start the main trading system**:
```bash
python run_trading_system.py
```

2. **Test the system with simulation**:
```bash
python test_trading_system.py
```

### Command Line Options

The system supports graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C or system signals.

## üìä System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **TradingSystem**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all components
2. **MarketDataManager**: Handles real-time market data collection and analysis
3. **OpportunityScanner**: Identifies and scores arbitrage opportunities
4. **RiskManager**: Manages risk controls and position sizing
5. **TradeExecutor**: Executes trades through the Kraken API
6. **KrakenAPI**: API client for Kraken exchange integration

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Market Data Collection
- Fetches real-time ticker data for all configured trading pairs
- Maintains price history for momentum and volatility calculations
- Updates market data every scan interval (default: 1 second)

### 2. Opportunity Detection
- Analyzes bid-ask spreads for potential arbitrage opportunities
- Calculates profit percentages and compares against minimum thresholds
- Identifies trading opportunities that meet profitability criteria

### 3. Confidence Scoring
The system uses a multi-factor confidence scoring algorithm:
- **Profit Weight (40%)**: Higher profit percentage increases confidence
- **Volume Weight (20%)**: Higher volume increases confidence
- **Momentum Weight (20%)**: Price momentum affects confidence
- **Volatility Penalty (10%)**: High volatility decreases confidence
- **Spread Consistency (10%)**: Consistent spreads increase confidence

### 4. Risk Management
- Daily trade limits to prevent over-trading
- Daily loss limits for capital protection
- Position sizing based on account balance and confidence
- Minimum liquidity requirements
- Real-time risk assessment for each trade

### 5. Trade Execution
- Places simultaneous buy and sell orders to capture spreads
- Monitors order execution and handles failures gracefully
- Updates risk metrics after each trade
- Logs all trading activity for analysis

### 6. System Monitoring
- Automatic system interrupt if no trades for 10+ minutes without justification
- Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- Performance tracking and reporting

## üìà Performance Monitoring

The system tracks several key metrics:

- **Trade Success Rate**: Percentage of successful trades
- **Daily P&L**: Profit and loss for the current day
- **Total P&L**: Cumulative profit and loss
- **Average Profit per Trade**: Mean profit across all trades
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Returns adjusted for risk taken

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Controls

### Built-in Safety Features

1. **Daily Limits**: Maximum trades and losses per day
2. **Position Sizing**: Automatic position sizing based on confidence and balance
3. **Minimum Thresholds**: Profit and liquidity minimums
4. **System Interrupts**: Automatic shutdown on anomalous behavior
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Risk Parameters

- Maximum 10% of balance per trade
- Maximum 20% portfolio exposure in active trades
- Automatic stop-loss at 2% adverse movement
- Daily loss limit of $500 (configurable)

## üìù Logging

The system maintains detailed logs including:

- All market data updates
- Opportunity detection and scoring
- Risk assessment decisions
- Trade execution details
- System performance metrics
- Error conditions and recovery

Log files are automatically rotated to prevent excessive disk usage.

## üß™ Testing

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
python test_trading_system.py
```

The test suite includes:
- Market data collection tests
- Opportunity scanning tests
- Risk management tests
- Trade execution simulation
- Full system integration tests

### Simulation Mode

The test system uses mock data to validate functionality without real trading:
- Simulated market data with realistic spreads
- Mock API responses for safe testing
- Comprehensive validation of all system components

## üìä Expected Performance

### Typical Metrics (Simulated)

- **Profit per Trade**: 0.3% - 1.5%
- **Trades per Day**: 20-100 (depending on market conditions)
- **Success Rate**: 60-80%
- **Daily Returns**: 1-5% (highly variable)

**Note**: Actual performance will vary significantly based on market conditions, configuration, and execution timing.
